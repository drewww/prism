--- An 'Action' is a command that affects a discrete change in the game state.
--- An Action consists of an owner, a name, a list of targets, and a list of target objects.
--- See Target for more.
--- @class prism.Action : prism.Object
--- @field time number The time it takes to perform this action. Lower is better.
--- @field silent boolean A silent action doesn't generate messages
--- @field owner prism.Actor The actor taking the action.
--- @field source prism.Actor? An object granting the owner of the action this action. A wand's zap action is a good example.
--- @field targets [prism.Target]
--- @field targetObjects [prism.Object]
--- @field requiredComponents prism.Component[]
--- @overload fun(owner: prism.Actor, targets: prism.Target[]): prism.Action
--- @type prism.Action

---@param targets [prism.Object]? An optional list of target actors. Not all actions require targets.
---@param source prism.Actor? An optional actor indicating the source of that action, for stuff like a wand or scroll.
