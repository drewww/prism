--- The `Component` class represents a component that can be attached to actors.
--- Components are used to add functionality to actors. For instance, the `Moveable` component
--- allows an actor to move around the map. Components are essentially data storage that can
--- also grant actions.
--- @class prism.Component : prism.Object
--- @field name string Each component prototype MUST have a unique name!
--- @field requirements table A list of component prototypes the actor must first have, before this can be applied.
--- @field owner prism.Actor The Actor this component is composing. This is set by Actor when a component is added or removed.
--- @overload fun(): prism.Component
--- @type prism.Component
local Component = prism.Object:extend("Component")
Component.requirements = {}

--- Called after the actor is loaded and ready, this is where the component should do any initialization requiring
--- the actor. This would include stuff like attaching systems, etc.
--- @param owner prism.Actor
function Component:initialize(owner) end

--- Checks whether an actor has the required components to attach this component.
--- @param actor prism.Actor The actor to check the requirements against.
--- @return boolean meetsRequirements the actor meets all requirements, false otherwise.
