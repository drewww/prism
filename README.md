# prism2

**prism2** is a roguelike game engine written in **Lua** for use with **Love2d**, inspired by Bob Nystrom's talk on roguelike architecture. It utilizes the **command pattern** and **composition** to provide a modular, extensible foundation for creating turn-based games.

Released under the **MIT License**, prism2 is free to use for both personal and commercial projects.

## Features

- **Command Pattern**: Encapsulates actions as discrete commands, enabling clean and decoupled turn-based mechanics.
- **Composition-Based Design**: Promotes flexibility using an Entity-Component-System (ECS)-style approach.
- **Event Listener System**: React to in-game events dynamically, such as status effects, traps, and environment interactions.
- **Lightweight and Modular**: Built in Lua, prism2 is designed to be lean and easy to use.
