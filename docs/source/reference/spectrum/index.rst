Spectrum
========
The spectrum module extends the core engine with features like a display,
camera, game states, and more. You don't `have` to use anything here,
but we try to make it applicable to as many games as possible. Its 
classes can be accessed with the ``spectrum`` global, e.g. ``spectrum.Display``.
